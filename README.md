## GestureDetector
This is a simple gesture detector for Godot using GDNative.  
The main native library is GestureInterpretor.cpp, which should be put in a control node.
Note: You may need to edit GestureInterpretor.gdns to include the library for your platform if you're not using Linux.
Also, put your godot c++ library in res://godot-cpp
